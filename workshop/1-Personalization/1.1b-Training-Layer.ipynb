    "With our three datasets imported into our dataset group, we can now turn to training models. As a reminder, we will be training three models in this workshop to support four different personalization use-cases wth three different models. One model will be used to make related product recommendations on the product detail view/page, another model will be used to make personalized product recommendations to users on the homepage, and the last model will be used to rerank product lists on the category and featured products page. This last model will be repurposed to offer discounts to users. In Amazon Personalize, training a model involves creating a Solution and Solution Version. So when we are finished we will have three solutions and a solution version for each solution. \n",
